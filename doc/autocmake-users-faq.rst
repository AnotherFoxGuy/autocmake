Should I include and track also files generated by Autocmake in my repository?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, you probably want to do that. Autocmake generates a number of files which
in principle could be generated at configure- or build-time.  However, you
probably do not want the users of your code to run any Autocmake scripts like
``update.py`` to generate the files they need to build the project. They will
run ``setup.py`` directly and expect everything to just work (TM).
