Requirements and dependencies
=============================

Autocmake update and test scripts require Python 2.7 or higher. We try to also
support Python 3 (tested with Python 3.4). If the script fails with Python 3,
consider this a bug and please file an issue.

The generated setup script runs with Python >= 2.6 (also tested with Python
3.4; probably also lower).
