Requirements and dependencies
=============================

The ``update.py`` script requires Python >= 2.7. We try to also
support Python 3. If the script fails with Python 3, consider this
as bug.

The generated CMake infrastructure requires CMake >= 2.8.
The generated ``setup.py`` runs with Python >= 2.7 (also Python 3).

.. todo::

   Figure out lower Python version bound for setup.py.
   Figure out upper Python version bounds.
