Requirements and dependencies
=============================

Autocmake update and test scripts require Python 2.7 or higher. We try to also
support Python 3 (tested with Python 3.4). If the script fails with Python 3,
consider this a bug and please file an issue.

The generated CMake infrastructure requires CMake >= 2.8.  The generated
``setup.py`` runs with Python >= 2.7 (also tested with Python 3.4; probably also lower).

   Figure out lower Python version bound for setup.py.
